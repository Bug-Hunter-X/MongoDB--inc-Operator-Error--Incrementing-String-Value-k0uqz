# MongoDB $inc Operator Error
This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB update operations.  The `$inc` operator is designed to increment numerical values by a specified amount.  Attempting to increment a string value will result in unexpected behavior or an error.

## Bug Description:
The provided code snippet attempts to increment a field that contains a string value using the `$inc` operator.  This results in the field not being incremented correctly.

## Solution:
The solution involves ensuring that the field being incremented is of a numeric type (e.g., NumberInt, NumberLong). If it is a string, convert it to a number first.
